Welcome to my newly redesigned personal website! After running my previous site for a while, I decided it was time for a fresh look and a more robust platform for sharing my work.

## What's New

This site is built with modern web technologies:

- **11ty (Eleventy)** - A simpler static site generator that gives me full control over the output
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Dark mode** - Because your eyes deserve it

## What You'll Find Here

This website serves as my central hub for:

- **Research** - My academic work on AI/ML for operations, logistics optimization, and simulation
- **Projects** - Both open source (Kwik, Simulatte) and industrial collaborations
- **Teaching** - Information about courses I teach at UniMORE
- **Blog** - Occasional thoughts on research, software development, and more

## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in new collaborations and discussions. Feel free to reach out through the [contact page](/contact/) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidemezzogori/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dmezzogori).
